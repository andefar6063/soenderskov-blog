Welcome back to "Breaking the Mold," where we dive into businesses that are making waves in their industries. Last time, we chatted about Terminal Shop and their unique approach to selling coffee. Today, we're switching gears to talk about a company that's out to murder your thirst... in style.

From the title, you already know who and what it's all about. Enter Liquid Death, the water company that's turning heads and has been doing so since 2017. Liquid Death was created by Mike Cessario, and he's a marketing genius. He's made water cool through marketing itself as a funny beverage company, whose mission is to make people laugh and get them to drink more healthy beverages, all while helping to kill plastic pollution. This marketing method has led to significant success; hence it's a company valued at more than a billion dollars.

Now, you might be thinking, "It's just water. What's the big deal?" But here's where Liquid Death breaks the mold. Think back to what I said about their mission. This mission is actually one that Liquid Death lives up to!

- Making people laugh? Yes -> through hilarious content, Liquid Death has people actually excited about hydration.
- Getting more to drink healthier beverages? Yes -> At its core, Liquid Death is selling waterâ€”the healthiest beverage on the planet.
- Helping to kill plastic pollution? Yes... AGAIN -> Their water comes in infinitely recyclable aluminum cans. Mother Earth approves!

I understand that you might also think that all this isn't possible for your company. But even so, there are still lots of learning to be done from this case. Here are the most important takeaways from this case:

1. Marketing is king. A great product with mediocre marketing often loses to a mediocre product with great marketing.
2. Live your brand values. Liquid Death's commitment to its mission builds trust and fuels its marketing machine.
3. Don't be afraid to disrupt. Even in a saturated market like bottled water, there is always room for innovation.
4. Make it fun! Who knew water could be so entertaining?
