Hi there! This is my first blog post that's going to go onto my website. I'm not making this for any other sake than to explain why I made this blog.

While I've been doing my daily coding challenge, I've found that my knowledge sticks around much longer when I write it down. Thus, I'll explain it using my own vocabulary.

You already know this. I also find topics like economics, businesses, and hardware and software engineering interesting. These are tough topics. If I could summarize them in one sentence, it would be: The deeper you go, the more you see there is to understand.

So, to clean up my own mind and showcase my progress, I've made this blog.
